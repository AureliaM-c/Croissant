    <p>
      The croissant is a buttery, flaky pastry that has become one of the most
      beloved symbols of French baking. Despite its strong association with
      France, the croissant's origins trace back to Austria. It was inspired by
      the Kipferl, a crescent-shaped pastry popular in Vienna as early as the
      13th century. The croissant as we know it today was perfected in France in
      the 19th century, where bakers refined the recipe using laminated dough ‚Äî
      a process that creates those delicate, airy layers. Crisp on the outside,
      soft and buttery inside, the croissant is often enjoyed fresh from the
      oven with a caf√© au lait, or filled with chocolate, almonds, or ham and
      cheese for a delicious twist.
